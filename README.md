This is the repository for my DFW data science talk about Pandas.

Here, you'll find the Jupyter notebook + files I used during my talk.  The notebook will fill up over the course of the session, with about a 1-minute delay between my typing and the updating.  The notebook will remain after the session is over, so please enjoy and share!
